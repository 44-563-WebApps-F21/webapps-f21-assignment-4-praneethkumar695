        ACT III _Corridor in the Duke’s Palace_ <br>
    </h3>
    <h4>
        _A large corridor in the Ducal Palace_: _a window_ (_L.C._) _looks out on
    a view of Padua by moonlight_: _a staircase_ (_R.C._) _leads up to a door
    with a portière of crimson velvet_, _with the Duke’s arms embroidered in
    gold on it_: _on the lowest step of the staircase a figure draped in
    black is sitting_: _the hall is lit by an iron cresset filled with
    burning tow_: _thunder and lightning outside_: _the time is night_.<br><br>
    [_Enter_ GUIDO _through the window_.]
    </h4>      
    <p>
DUCHESS<br>
   There is no barrier between us now.<br>
GUIDO<br>
   None, love, nor shall be.<br>
DUCHESS<br>
   I have seen to that.<br>
GUIDO<br>
   Tarry here for me.<br>
DUCHESS<br>
   No, you are not going?<br>
   You will not leave me as you did before?<br>
GUIDO<br>
   I will return within a moment’s space,<br>
   But first I must repair to the Duke’s chamber,<br>
   And leave this letter and this dagger there,<br>
   That when he wakes—
DUCHESS<br>
   When who wakes?<br>
GUIDO<br>
   Why, the Duke.<br>
DUCHESS<br>
   He will not wake again.<br>
GUIDO<br>
   What, is he dead?<br>
DUCHESS<br>
   Ay! he is dead.<br>
GUIDO<br>
   O God! how wonderful<br>
   Are all thy secret ways!  Who would have said<br>
   That on this very night, when I had yielded<br>
   Into thy hands the vengeance that is thine,<br>
   Thou with thy finger wouldst have touched the man,<br>
   And bade him come before thy judgment seat.<br>
DUCHESS<br>
   I have just killed him.<br>
GUIDO [_in horror_]<br>
   Oh!<br>
DUCHESS<br>
   He was asleep;<br>
   Come closer, love, and I will tell you all.<br>
   I had resolved to kill myself to-night.<br>
   About an hour ago I waked from sleep,<br>
   And took my dagger from beneath my pillow,<br>
   Where I had hidden it to serve my need,<br>
   And drew it from the sheath, and felt the edge,<br>
   And thought of you, and how I loved you, Guido,<br>
   And turned to fall upon it, when I marked<br>
   The old man sleeping, full of years and sin;<br>
   There lay he muttering curses in his sleep,<br>
   And as I looked upon his evil face<br>
   Suddenly like a flame there flashed across me,<br>
   There is the barrier which Guido spoke of:<br>
   You said there lay a barrier between us,<br>
   What barrier but he?—<br>
   I hardly know<br>
   What happened, but a steaming mist of blood<br>
   Rose up between us two.<br>
GUIDO<br>
   Oh, horrible!<br>
DUCHESS<br>
   And then he groaned,<br>
   And then he groaned no more!  I only heard<br>
   The dripping of the blood upon the floor.<br>
GUIDO<br>
   Enough, enough.<br>
DUCHESS<br>
   Will you not kiss me now?<br>
   Do you remember saying that women’s love<br>
   Turns men to angels? well, the love of man<br>
   Turns women into martyrs; for its sake<br>
   We do or suffer anything.<br>
GUIDO<br>
   O God!<br>
DUCHESS<br>
   Will you not speak?<br>
GUIDO<br>
   I cannot speak at all.<br>
