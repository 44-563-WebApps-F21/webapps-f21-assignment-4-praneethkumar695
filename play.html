        ACT III _Corridor in the Duke’s Palace_ <br>
    </h3>
    <h4>
        _A large corridor in the Ducal Palace_: _a window_ (_L.C._) _looks out on
    a view of Padua by moonlight_: _a staircase_ (_R.C._) _leads up to a door
    with a portière of crimson velvet_, _with the Duke’s arms embroidered in
    gold on it_: _on the lowest step of the staircase a figure draped in
    black is sitting_: _the hall is lit by an iron cresset filled with
    burning tow_: _thunder and lightning outside_: _the time is night_.<br><br>

   <p class="speech">There is no barrier between us now.</p>
<h6 class="speech guido">GUIDO</h6>
   <p class="speech">None, love, nor shall be.</p>
<h6 class="speech duchess">DUCHESS</h6>
   <p class="speech">I have seen to that.</p>
<h6 class="speech guido">GUIDO</h6>
   <p class="speech">Tarry here for me.</p>
<h6 class="speech duchess">DUCHESS</h6>
   <p class="speech">No, you are not going?<br>
      You will not leave me as you did before?</p>
<h6 class="speech guido">GUIDO</h6>
   <p class="speech">I will return within a moment’s space,<br>
   But first I must repair to the Duke’s chamber,<br>
   And leave this letter and this dagger there,<br>
   That when he wakes—</p>
<h6 class="speech duchess">DUCHESS</h6>
  <p class="speech">When who wakes?</p>
<h6 class="speech guido">GUIDO</h6>
  <p class="speech">Why, the Duke.</p>
<h6 class="speech duchess">DUCHESS</h6>
   <pclass="speech">He will not wake again.</p>
<h6 class="speech guido">GUIDO</h6>
   <p class="speech">What, is he dead?</p>
<h6 class="speech duchess">DUCHESS</h6>
   <p class="speech">Ay! he is dead.<br></p>
<h6 class="speech guido">GUIDO</h6>
   <p class="speech">O God! how wonderful<br>
   Are all thy secret ways!  Who would have said<br>
   That on this very night, when I had yielded<br>
   Into thy hands the vengeance that is thine,<br>
   Thou with thy finger wouldst have touched the man,<br>
   And bade him come before thy judgment seat.<br></p>
<h6 class="speech duchess">DUCHESS</h6>
   <p class="speech">I have just killed him.</p>
<h6 class="speech guido">GUIDO</h6> <p class="stagedirections">[_in horror_]<br></p>
   Oh!<br>
<h6 class="speech duchess">DUCHESS</h6>
   <p class="speech">He was asleep;<br>
   Come closer, love, and I will tell you all.<br>
   I had resolved to kill myself to-night.<br>
   About an hour ago I waked from sleep,<br>
   And took my dagger from beneath my pillow,<br>
   Where I had hidden it to serve my need,<br>
   And drew it from the sheath, and felt the edge,<br>
   And thought of you, and how I loved you, Guido,<br>
   And turned to fall upon it, when I marked<br>
   The old man sleeping, full of years and sin;<br>
   There lay he muttering curses in his sleep,<br>
   And as I looked upon his evil face<br>
   Suddenly like a flame there flashed across me,<br>
   There is the barrier which Guido spoke of:<br>
   You said there lay a barrier between us,<br>
   What barrier but he?—<br>
   I hardly know<br>
   What happened, but a steaming mist of blood<br>
   Rose up between us two.<br></p>
<h6 class="speech guido">GUIDO</h6>
   <p class="speech">Oh, horrible!</p>
<h6 class="speech duchess">DUCHESS</h6>
   <pclass="speech">And then he groaned,<br>
   And then he groaned no more!  I only heard<br>
   The dripping of the blood upon the floor.<br></p>
<h6 class="speech guido">GUIDO</h6>
   <p class="speech">Enough, enough</p>
<h6 class="speech duchess">DUCHESS</h6>
   <p class="speech">Will you not kiss me now?<br>
   Do you remember saying that women’s love<br>
   Turns men to angels? well, the love of man<br>
   Turns women into martyrs; for its sake<br>
   We do or suffer anything.<br></p>
<h6 class="speech guido">GUIDO</h6>
   <p class="speech">O God!</p>
<h6 class="speech duchess">DUCHESS</h6>
   <p class="speech">Will you not speak?</p>
<h6 class="speech guido">GUIDO</h6>
   <p class="speech">I cannot speak at all.</p>
<h6 class="speech duchess">DUCHESS</h6> 
   <p class="speech">Let as not talk of this!  Let us go hence:<br>
      Is not the barrier broken down between us?<br>
      What would you more?  Come, it is almost morning.<br></p>
