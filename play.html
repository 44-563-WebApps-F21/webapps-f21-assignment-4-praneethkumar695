      ACT III _Corridor in the Duke’s Palace_ <br>
   </h3>
   <h4>
      _A large corridor in the Ducal Palace_: _a window_ (_L.C._) _looks out on
      a view of Padua by moonlight_: _a staircase_ (_R.C._) _leads up to a door
      with a portière of crimson velvet_, _with the Duke’s arms embroidered in
      gold on it_: _on the lowest step of the staircase a figure draped in
      black is sitting_: _the hall is lit by an iron cresset filled with
      burning tow_: _thunder and lightning outside_: _the time is night_.<br><br>
      <p class="stagedirections">[_Enter_ GUIDO _through the window_.]</p>

      You will not leave me as you did before?</p>
   <h6 class="name"><i class="fas fa-user">GUIDO</i></h6>
   <p class="speech guido">I will return within a moment’s space,<br>
      But first I must repair to the Duke’s chamber,<br>
      And leave this letter and this dagger there,<br>
      That when he wakes—</p>

   <p class="speech duchess">When who wakes?</p>

   <p class="speech guido">Why, the Duke.</p>
   <h6 class="name"><i class="fas fa-user">DUCHESS</i></h6>
   <p class="speech duchess">He will not wake again.</p>
      <h6 class="name"><i class="fas fa-user">GUIDO</i></h6>
      <p class="speech guido">What, is he dead?</p>
      <h6 class="name"><i class="fas fa-user">DUCHESS</i></h6>
      <p class="speech duchess">Ay! he is dead.<br></p>
      <h6 class="name"><i class="fas fa-user">GUIDO</i></h6>
      <p class="speech guido">O God! how wonderful<br>
         Are all thy secret ways! Who would have said<br>
         That on this very night, when I had yielded<br>
         Into thy hands the vengeance that is thine,<br>
         Thou with thy finger wouldst have touched the man,<br>
         And bade him come before thy judgment seat.<br></p>
      <h6 class="name"><i class="fas fa-user">DUCHESS</i></h6>
      <p class="speech duchess">I have just killed him.</p>
      <h6 class="name"><i class="fas fa-user">GUIDO</i></h6>
      <p class="stagedirections">[_in horror_]<br></p>
      Oh!<br>
      <h6 class="name"><i class="fas fa-user">DUCHESS</i></h6>
      <p class="speech duchess">He was asleep;<br>
         Come closer, love, and I will tell you all.<br>
         I had resolved to kill myself to-night.<br>
         About an hour ago I waked from sleep,<br>
         And took my dagger from beneath my pillow,<br>
         Where I had hidden it to serve my need,<br>
         And drew it from the sheath, and felt the edge,<br>
         And thought of you, and how I loved you, Guido,<br>
         And turned to fall upon it, when I marked<br>
         The old man sleeping, full of years and sin;<br>
         There lay he muttering curses in his sleep,<br>
         And as I looked upon his evil face<br>
         Suddenly like a flame there flashed across me,<br>
         There is the barrier which Guido spoke of:<br>
         You said there lay a barrier between us,<br>
         What barrier but he?—<br>
         I hardly know<br>
         What happened, but a steaming mist of blood<br>
         Rose up between us two.<br></p>
      <h6 class="name"><i class="fas fa-user">GUIDO</i></h6>
      <p class="speech guido">Oh, horrible!</p>
      <h6 class="name"><i class="fas fa-user">DUCHESS</i></h6>
      <p class="speech duchess">And then he groaned,<br>
         And then he groaned no more! I only heard<br>
         The dripping of the blood upon the floor.<br></p>
         <h6 class="name"><i class="fas fa-user">GUIDO</i></h6>
         <p class="speech guido">Enough, enough</p>
